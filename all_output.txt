The architecture for this simple website will consist of two core files:

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that will be served to the client. It will contain a single `<h1>` tag with the text "Fabian was here".

2. `server.py`: This is a simple Python server using Flask to serve the `index.html` file.

Let's start with the `index.html` file:

index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Simple Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Fabian was here</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Next, we have the `server.py` file:

server.py
```python
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory

app = Flask(__name__, static_url_path='')

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return send_from_directory('', 'index.html')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(port=8000)
```

In this Python script, we're creating a Flask web server that serves the `index.html` file when the root URL (`/`) is accessed. We're running the server on port 8000.

Finally, we need to create a `requirements.txt` file to specify the Flask dependency:

requirements.txt
```plaintext
Flask==1.1.2
```

To run this website, you would first install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then run the server with `python server.py`. You can then access the website by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
